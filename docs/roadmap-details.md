# ElysiumX Roadmap

Our roadmap outlines the strategic development and key milestones for the ElysiumX ecosystem. We are committed to delivering a robust and innovative DeFi platform, continuously expanding our offerings and strengthening our community.

## Q3 2025: Foundation & Initial Launch

-   **Launch Presale & Listing on Raydium/Orca/Uniswap:** This quarter focuses on the initial public offering of ELY tokens through a presale event, followed by listings on major decentralized exchanges like Raydium, Orca, and Uniswap. This step is crucial for establishing initial liquidity and broader accessibility for the ELY token.

## Q4 2025: Core DeFi Infrastructure

-   **Deploy Smart Contracts for Staking & Rewards:** We will deploy the foundational smart contracts that enable ELY holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards. This mechanism is designed to incentivize long-term holding and active participation within the ecosystem, fostering a stable and engaged community.

## Q1 2026: Enhanced Trading Experience

-   **DEX Aggregator Integration:** This phase will see the integration of a DEX aggregator into the ElysiumX platform. This will allow users to find the best possible swap rates across various decentralized exchanges, optimizing their trading experience and ensuring efficient liquidity utilization.

## Q2 2026: User-Centric Access

-   **Launch Digital Wallet:** We will introduce our own user-friendly digital wallet, designed to seamlessly integrate with the ElysiumX ecosystem. This wallet will provide a secure and intuitive interface for managing ELY tokens and interacting with our DeFi services.

## Q3 2026: Real-World Asset Integration

-   **Marketplace Asset Tokenization:** This quarter marks a significant step towards bridging traditional finance with DeFi. We will launch a marketplace enabling the tokenization of real-world assets, opening up new investment opportunities and expanding the utility of the ElysiumX platform.

## Q4 2026: Decentralized Governance & Expansion

-   **DAO Governance & Institutional Partnership:** The final phase of our initial roadmap focuses on fully decentralizing the governance of ElysiumX through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This will empower ELY holders with direct decision-making power. Concurrently, we will pursue strategic partnerships with institutional entities to further expand the reach and adoption of ElysiumX.
